# node-graphql

First date with graphql and node.js. Using graphql in place of REST.

Build with npm install , and run with node app.js.

There's a React app at localhost:3001, but there's also GraphiQL (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) at localhost:3001/graphql.

Stack is:
  React + Apollo - front
  Node.js Express - back
  MongoDB in cloud - db
